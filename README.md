# [WIP] Wifi-probe

Wifi endpoint scanner designed to detect insecure networks.

Designed for use on a raspberry pi with lcd.

If you can figure out the wiring based on the LCD configuration, here's how you start:
```bash
$> git clone 
$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$> sudo python3 ./start_pi.py
```
Coming soon....
